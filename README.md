> A murder mystery mod for Hideous Destructor...

This mod is designed for multiplayer, and should be targeting from [hd4.10.0a onwards](https://codeberg.org/mc776/HideousDestructor/releases). To set up the game, the game must be in deathmatch and the `fraglimit` set to 100. Recommended that 3-8 players are in the game.

## Mechanics / How to Play
The players have a 20 second brace period before a murderer is chosen. It'll be announced in the logs on who's the murderer. You'll know you've become the murderer by an additional log and an undroppable knife in your inventory.

Rocket Launcher, BFG, Liberator, Thunder Buster, and Brontornis spawns are disabled for a good reason. All players are allowed to pick up and use weapons placed by the map.

For those who aren't familiar with this game, the objective for the innocents is to kill the murderer before the murderer kills them all.
You must cooperate with your teammates to increase the chances of winning (more appropriately, survival).

Each player has green armor worn, a pistol, a spare magazine, and a medikit at spawn.
Both sides are allowed to pick up and use items from the map. Have fun deducing.
